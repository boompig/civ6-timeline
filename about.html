		<h1 class="display-1">About</h1>

		<p>I used to play a lot of chess, and part of getting better was analyzing your past games.
			Getting better at Civ6 is hard, in part because games are long, and identifying areas of improvement is not
			always obvious.
			For a while, I plateaued at Immortal - I could win all my Immortal games but not a single game at Deity (at
			least without cheating).
			I tried to figure out what separates the expert players on YouTube or Reddit from myself, but I couldn't
			point to a single thing.
			During my past few Civ games, I took extensive notes on what I did and why, what my opponent was doing at
			the time, etc.
			These notes really helped me improve, because I could point to specific mistakes in my gameplay.
			Helpful, but also tedious.
		</p>

		<p>Civ6 itself records the game, and generates a timeline file for export. You can find it in
			<code>C:\Users\<USER>\Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\GameSummary</code>.
			It works similarly to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation">PGN</a> file in
			online chess - it records all your actions in a text format, so you can analyze the game later.
			I wrote a program to visualize these files, so you can see what you did and when, and hopefully that will
			help you improve.
		</p>

		<!-- <p><a href="https://github.com/boompig/civ6-timeline">The code is free and open source</a> so anyone can take
			this and improve on it.
			I've also <a href="https://boompig.github.io/civ6-timeline">set up a website</a> where this program is
			deployed.</p> -->

		<h2 class="display-4">Future Work</h2>

		<p>If the Civ6 community likes this idea, I will add the following features, which I think are useful:</p>

		<ul>
			<!-- <li><strong>Sharable timelines</strong> Upload your timeline and get a link so you can directly share the
				timeline with friends or on Reddit/forums.
			</li> -->
			<li><strong>Annotations</strong> Chess players like to add notes to certain moves after their games. This
				would allow players to add notes to themselves or reviewers about their thoughts directly into the
				timeline</li>
			<li><strong>Gathering Storm</strong> I haven't played Gathering Storm yet so I have no idea if this will work for files generated by that expansion.
			If you have some timeline files from that game, try the service and share your results with me <a href="https://twitter.com/boompig">on Twitter</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Or possibly other features suggested by folks on Reddit, if it's not too difficult and technically possible
			(the timeline file is missing a lot of info).</p>

		<h2 class="display-4">Cost</h2>

		<p>
			Right now, you can upload game files and share the link with anyone to view someone else's files.
			I'll keep it running for this demo, but in the long-term that's not free.
			My own games files are around 1-3MB (uncompressed). While storing all of my own games is well under $1/year,
			storing a few dozen game files for a few hundred people would mean about 10GB of storage.
			That's not expensive but it's also not free.
			I'm happy to run the service if a few folks express an interest in paying some trivial sum to subsidize it (probably $1/person/month would be more than enough).
		</p>

		<h2 class="display-4">Limitations</h2>

		<p>I would love to add this information to the visualization, but it's just not present in the underlying data.
			This is an incomplete list:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Battles are not annotated with which civilizations participated in those battles. You can infer it from
				DOW information sometimes, but not always. Same thing for ships sunk.</li>
			<li>Pantheon Founded - not annotated with name of specific pantheon</li>
			<li>Goody Hut Triggered - not annotated with yields</li>
			<li>City Built on Desert - no city name annotation</li>
		</ul>
